<!-- Physisist. Data Scientist. Machine learning consulting. PhD candidate. -->
Hi! I am currently doing a Dual PhD in Neuromorphic Computing and Sensing, at the University of Hertfordshire (UK) and the Western Sydney University (AU). Passionate about biologically inspired sensor mechanisms, neuromorphic computing, data science, and the development of intelligent systems across various fields.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
